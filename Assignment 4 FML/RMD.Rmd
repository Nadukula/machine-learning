#Task-a. Use only the numerical variables (1 to 9) to cluster the 21 firms. Justify the various choices made in conducting the cluster analysis, such as weights for different variables, the specific clustering algorithm(s) used, the number of clusters formed, and so on.

#Task-b. Interpret the clusters with respect to the numerical variables used in forming the clusters.
#By looking at the mean values of all quantitative variables in each cluster.

#Cluster 1 - JNJ, MRK, PFE, GSK

#Cluster 2 - AHM,WPI,AVE

#Cluster 3 - CHTT,ELN,MRX,IVX

#Cluster 4 - BAY,PHA,AGN

#Cluster 5 - AZN,ABT,NVS,BMY,WYE,SGP,LLY

#Cluster 1 has highest Market_cap,ROA,ROE,Asset_Turnover and lowest is Beta,PE_Ratio.

#Cluster 2 has highest Rev_Growth and lowest PE_Ratio, Asset_Turnover. 

#Cluster 3 has highest Beta, Leverage and lowest Market_Cap, ROE, ROA, Leverage, Rev_Growth, Net_Profit_Margin.

#Cluster 4 has highest PE_Ratio and lowest Leverage, Asset_Turnover.

#Cluster 5 has highest Net_Profit_Margin and lowest leverage,Beta. 

#Task-c. Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variables (10 to 12)? (those not used in 
#forming the clusters)

#With respect to the Media recommendation variable, there is a pattern in the clusters.

#Cluster 1 with highest ROA, highest Asset_Turnover , highest Market_cap, highest ROE has equal Hold and strong Buy Recommendation less risky nature.

#Cluster 2 with lowest Asset_Turnover and lowest PE_Ratio we considered as  undervalued stock but moderate  risky nature and  moderate Recommendation.

#Cluster-3 with highest Leverage, highest Beta has mostly too risky nature  it is less Recommendation to risk averse investors .

#Cluster 4 with highest PE_Ratio that means all stocks in this cluster are overvalued so it advisible to  sell Recommendation.

#Cluster 5 with highest Net_Profit_Margin has mostly Hold Recommendation.

#In terms of variables, I have seen a pattern among the clusters (10 to 12)

#Clusters 1,3 has mostly Moderate Buy Recommendation

#Clusters 1,2,4,5 has Hold Recommendation

#Task-d. Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset.

#Cluster-1 - strong Buy Recommendation (less risky nature)..

#Cluster-2 - Moderately Hold cluster

#Cluster-3 - high sell Recommendation cluster (high risky nature)

#Cluster-4 - low sell Recommendation cluster

#Cluster-5 - strong Hold cluster.
